# DetctionOpenCv
the projetc detectionopencv devlopped by python and opencv library is one of project how using the new technologies of dections objects and faces.
also it used the OCR to recocnized the object detected.
to use this project you just need to compile it with the webcam based on data already implemented.
#first issue detected 
once the image is detected,it is considered as a new image never seen so we are looking for a solution that allows us
to memorize the images and add them to the data once they are detected.

we are looking to merge python, tensorflow and opencv to build
a neural network for the machine in order to use deep learning in image detection.
